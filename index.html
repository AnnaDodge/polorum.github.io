<a id="what-we-do" class="anchor" href="#what-we-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What We Do</h2>

<p>Last summer, while the Ebola outbreak wreaked havoc in West Africa, another disease outbreak occurred in a rural community in East Africa. The disease was typhoid and in the first three months of the outbreak awareness was at only 15% in the local community. Between July and November 2014 there were 600 typhoid infections and 46 deaths recorded by the single hospital serving 12,000 people. The devastation wreaked by the disease was augmented by the fact that the hospital had no method of communicating news of the outbreak to its benefactors. Coupling our technical expertise with knowledge of rural Africa ZvakanakaSMS have built a cost- effective solution to the problem of disseminating potentially life-saving information to communities by capitalising on the high regional mobile phone ownership.We are aware that not every day is an emergency, or disease outbreak; however, there is no barrier to sending other types of information such as indicating the time and location of a community meeting, or selling advertising messages for sole traders based in the community.  Our system can be run by locals, providing individuals with employment, and ensuring that the information will be trusted if and when disaster strikes.</p>

<a id="the-system" class="anchor" href="#the-system" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The system</h2>

<p>Our system is extremely cheap priced at Â£500. It can be run without internet access, and without mains electricity. It fits into pre-existing infrastructure. Our software can hold over 40,000 phone numbers and complies with data protection regulations. We can also provide the technical expertise required to set-up a system in a community thereby allowing information to be transmitted in hours rather than months.There is a need for what we are doing, a simple solution that can be instantly implemented and accepted by the communities running the system.</p>

<h2>
<a id="about-us" class="anchor" href="#about-us" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About us</h2>

<p>Our expertise is in building cost-effective technology which we propose selling directly to organizations with their own supply chain, who deal directly with our target communities. By selling directly to partner organizations, who lack the technical expertise we can provide, ZvakanakaSMS can provide support. 

We are ZvakanakaSMS and we understand how to build cheap technology that can be introduced by development organizations and owned by communities, enabling them to transmit potentially life-saving information quickly.</p>
